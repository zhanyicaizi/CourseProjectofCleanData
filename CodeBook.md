# CodeBook of tidydata set

    This dataset has two parts. The first part is from 1st to 6th row, which indicated the mean on varibles (from the 3rd to 134th) of each activity. The second part is from 7th row to 27th row, which indicated the average mean on varibles (from the 3rd to 134th) of each subject.
    
### "AorS"
    Represent the means are on activity or subject. 
    On activity, AorS = "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING".
    On activity, AorS = "1","3","5,"6","7","8","11","14","15","16","17","19","21","22","23","25","26","27","28","29","30".
    
### From "TrainBodyAccMeanX" to "TrainfBody2GyroJMStd"
    The measurement (Mean or Std) of each measurement (tBodyAcc,tGravitAcc,tBodyAccJerk,tBodyGyro,tBodyGyroJerk,tBodyAccMag,tGravityAccMag,tBodyAccJerkMag,tBodyGyroMag,tBodyGyroJerkMag,fBodyAcc,fBodyAccJerk,fBodyGyro,fBodyAccMag,fBodyBodyAccJerkMag,fBodyBodyGyroMag,fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag) from the train data.
    
### From "TesttBodyAccMeanX" to "TestfBody2GyroJMStd"
    The measurement (Mean or Std) of each measurement (tBodyAcc,tGravitAcc,tBodyAccJerk,tBodyGyro,tBodyGyroJerk,tBodyAccMag,tGravityAccMag,tBodyAccJerkMag,tBodyGyroMag,tBodyGyroJerkMag,fBodyAcc,fBodyAccJerk,fBodyGyro,fBodyAccMag,fBodyBodyAccJerkMag,fBodyBodyGyroMag,fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag) from the test data.
